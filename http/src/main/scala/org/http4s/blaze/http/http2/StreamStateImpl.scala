/** Virtual pipeline head for representing HTTP/2 streams

  * It provides the junction for de-multiplexing stream messages
  * into an individual stream. It handles commands and errors for the
  * stream and manages the lifetime in the parent session accordingly.
  *
  * @note While `StreamState` does enforce the end-stream semantics
  *       defined by HTTP/2, it doesn't attempt to enforce the semantics
  *       of the HTTP dispatch, specifically it doesn't enforce that
  *       HEADERS come before DATA, etc, and that duty belongs to the
  *       streams dispatcher.
