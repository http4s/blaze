  /* HTTP2 Spec, 8.1.2 HTTP Header Fields

     Just as in HTTP/1.x, header field names are strings of ASCII characters that are compared
     in a case-insensitive fashion. However, header field names MUST be converted to lowercase
     prior to their encoding in HTTP/2. A request or response containing uppercase header
     field names MUST be treated as malformed (Section 8.1.2.6).
