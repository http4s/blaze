  * the supplier of the data (commonly a [[FrameDecoder]]) is responsible for ensuring that
  * the frames are properly formatted but doesn't concern itself with validating the sanity of a
  * frames content.
  *
  * For example, the [[FrameDecoder]] is responsible for ensuring that the body of a WINDOW_UPDATE
  * is 4 bytes long and the [[FrameListener]] would be expected to signal an error if the
  * window increment was 0 or the update was for an idle stream.
